# Cirno's Circuits Documentation


To avoid any confusion, these are general things I try to follow in all components:

- The least significant bit is always on the right when looking from the top down.
- If there is a clock input, it is always active on the rising edge.

I am only going to include more complex components in this, as the others should be self-explanatory.
